still Excel – creating a fragmented and brittle workflow."
excerpt: "One of the most common tasks for a Transcriptic user is viewing a dataset generated as part of an experiment
they submitted to the platform. The data viewing and interpretation tools available to life scientists today are
surprisingly limited, and a key offering of Transcriptic is enabling users to immediately explore and understand their
data."

### Problem Statement
One of Transcriptic's core capabilities is transparency into the data generated on the platform. When we execute an
experiment for a user, we present the data collected in that experiment as soon as it's available. This immediacy is a
huge value-add for Transcriptic.

However, before this project, the UI architecture for presenting datasets was crumbling. Users love having specific
visualizations for different types of datasets, but maintaining these many views was time-consuming and prone to
bugs. Datasets views often broke, and adding new views required extensive custom coding.

Furthermore, our approach to generating datasets had fundamental flaws. When a user requested to download a dataset, it
was generated on the fly using the current state of the system. This caused inconsistencies between downloads and
prevented proper auditing – a huge liability.

Finally, the existing interface lacked clean aesthetics and was hard to quickly scan and make sense of.

Transcriptic's Head of Product and I developed this *Job To Be Done* to guide this project.

> As a biologist using Transcriptic, I want to view and access the data generated in an experiment in a single location, so that I can quickly understand if an experiment was successful, and know how I should proceed with my work.

### Goals
My task was to provide a re-designed user experience for navigating and accessing datasets. The core requirements were:

1. **Extensible:** The proposed solution must work in a variety of contexts, and be easily adaptable to future needs as new dataset types are added.
2. **Audit-able:** It should be clear when a dataset was generated and apparent that the data contained within a dataset is static and represents a past state of the system.
3. **Compose-able:** Datasets are made up of Data Objects, and this solution should visually mirror that architecture.
4. **Useable:** Biologists have well defined approaches to data. Our solution should not dictate a preferred approach but instead meet Biologists where they stand.

### Research and Exploration
#### User Research

A size-able corpus of data from extensive 1:1 user interviews was the basis of data for this effort. From the basic synthesis of these interviews I identified following core user needs:

1. Biologists need to access data as soon as it’s available so that they can monitor the status of the experiment and make adjustments.
2. Biologists need to understand if a dataset has passed automatic validation so that they can determine if a dataset is worth analyzing further.
3. Biologists need to be able to sort, search and filter their data on the fly so that they can build a deeper understanding of the results.

#### Initial Sketches

My initial sketches focused on the core components needed to appropriately display data objects, with some basic attention paid to layout. These sketches were foundational to the final architecture proposed.

#### Architecture Brainstorming
From my visual exploration, I saw the beginnings of a hierarchical system. I suspected that I could develop a logical
system from which a multitude of consistent layouts could be composed.
