excerpt: "Transcriptic was founded in 2012 to transform the life sciences from a field of manual labor into one of
automation. Over seven years, until 2019, Transcriptic made dramatic progress in this regard. However, in February
of 2019, a strategic opportunity to expand the potential of Transcriptic's technology presented itself: a merger with
3Scan – a 3D tissue imaging startup. Over the course of 2019 Transcriptic and 3Scan combined and re-branded to Strateos.
Together, as a single entity, Strateos is positioned to push its technology further than ever before."

> At Strateos, our mission is to turn the life sciences into an information technology, driven by data, computation, and
  high-throughput robotics with the goal of substantially advancing drug discovery. Our team brings together deep
  expertise in biology, automation, and software engineering to set new standards for the way scientific research is done.

#### Product Overview
Starting in 2012, Transcriptic developed the first robotic cloud laboratory for on-demand life science research. This
platform consisted of state-of-the-art life-science devices mechanically integrated by robotics. The Transcriptic Common Lab
Environment (TCLE) – a cloud-based software suite – enabled scientists to submit and manage scientific experiments on
the robotic platform all through a single web-based user interface. Top pharmaceutical and biotech companies used the
Transcriptic robotic cloud lab in their own labs as well as externally through Transcriptic’s Cloud Bioassay Services.

Today, Transcriptic's products have been re-branded under the Strateos identity. Strateos supports Transcriptic's
original users – while simultaneously expanding the platform's capabilities to cloud-based biology
and <TextTip content="The branch of chemistry concerned with the creation of new pharmaceuticals.">medicinal chemistry</TextTip> experimentation.
Researchers can remotely submit their experiments, and sit back while our robots do the work. Along the way, they can
track the progress of their expirment in real time, allowing them to focus on accelerating discoveries instead of
labor-intensive bench work.

###### Advantages
- Scientists can focus on generating hypotheses and designing and analyzing experiments instead of doing tedious lab
  work.
- Reproducibility is improved with reduced chance of human error, saving time and money while accelerating drug
  development timelines.
- Capital expenditures are reduced on expensive equipment that’s used for a fraction of the time.

#### Strateos Products
Strateos's software addresses three separate categories of user needs. Several independent web applications provide
interfaces for these needs.

###### Cloud-Based Science
Strateos customers use our web app to perform biological assays and medicinal chemistry synthesis remotely, using our
robotic cloud infrastructure. This is our only customer facing application and demands the most design input.

###### Internal Lab Management
Strateos lab operators use an Admin Application to manage Strateos's lab inventory, keep tabs on the inventory of
clients, and launch and manage experiments that have been submitted by customers. The tasks that operators must complete
while following prompts from this application are extremely complex and crucial to execute correctly. A single misstep
could damage the entire supply of a customer’s sample.

###### Robotic Operation
Strateos operates robotic modules for executing biology experiments remotely. Lab operators manage these modules using a
scheduling dashboard. This app displays the current activity of the robotics, as well as tasks the operator needs to
complete for the module, such as handing off new materials, or receiving processed materials. It also exposes actions
the operator can take directly, such as emergency procedures or direct debugging commands.

#### Strateos Robotic Lab Facilities
The software described above is backed by robotic facilities, capable of carrying out experiments with little to no
human intervention. They're akin to data-centers, but the unit of operation being manipulation of measurement of
physical samples, instead of computation. Presently, Strateos operates two robotic labs.

###### Menlo Park
Our Menlo Park laboratory is Strateos's original facility, built by the Transcriptic team. It houses
four <TextTip content={<span><b>Workcell:</b> A collection of automated devices, each with capabilities useful to scientific experimentation, that are physically integrated by robotic arms. The arms move experimental samples between devices.</span>}>workcells</TextTip> that
each have different scientific capabilities.

<Image imgs={props.images} name="workcell" caption="One of the robotic workcells in operation in the Menlo Park robotic lab facility." />

We do most of our testing and development at this facility – before rolling out software and hardware improvements to
our other labs.

###### San Diego
After learning substantial lessons building and operating our Menlo Park facility, Strateos was ready to expand our
capabilities beyond biology alone. We partnered with Eli Lilly to bring online an 11,000 square foot robotic lab
in San Diego.

The facility is capable automating of both biology experiments as well as medicinal chemistry synthesis. Together, this
allows us to offer the tools for automated closed loop drug discovery – a first-of-its-kind capability.

#### A Design-Forward Product
Over the course of my 3+ years at Transcriptic and Strateos, I've focused on creating a culture of design across the
company. The life sciences so often ignore user-centered product development in favor of scientific exploration, and
I've made it my charge to ensure that our products are built with a design-centered methodology.
