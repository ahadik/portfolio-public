excerpt: "In 2014, as an undergraduate Computational Biology researcher, I spent my days wrestling with complex software
packages that were difficult to get working and even harder to use when you did. The contrast between these genetic
analysis tools, and the tools available to other disciplines – such as MATLAB or Mathematica – was stark. It shouldn't
have to be this way! When I stumbled upon Transcriptic on Angel List, I saw a company fashioning itself as a 
user-friendly, cloud-based biology platform. The value of the product was in the user-experience. I knew immediately
that this was a company I wanted to work for."

#### Crafting Better Tools for Scientists
When I joined Transcriptic in September 2016, it had been through several product cycles. At various points since its
founding in 2012, the team had built out services for DNA sequencing, <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</Link>, and
other popular biological techniques.

A talented contractor had done the original design work for these services. However as the company rapidly expanded
capabilities and wrestled with the UX shortcomings of internal tools, it was clear a designer that could work directly
with the engineering team, as well as the scientific team, was a necessary addition.

As a result, I joined, bringing with me my background in Computational Biology, Design and Front End Engineering. For
the past two years I have worked as the sole designer at Transcriptic building out tools, features and services for the
various teams and users of Transcriptic.
