excerpt: "One of the core components of my process during the Automated Chemical Synthesis project was a week long Design Sprint workshop. I planned and facilitated this workshop at the Eli Lilly campus in San Diego, California. Over the course of this week, I guided a group of scientists, engineers and executives through a co-creation experience to directly involve them in my design process."

#### Why A Design Sprint?
After completing and synthesizing the user research for the <Link to="/work/chemical-synthesis">Automated Chemical Synthesis project</Link>, I had a good sense of the general direction I needed to go. But before diving into solutions, I wanted to bring all the project stakeholders together to share information, and co-create. I also wanted to pro-actively create buy-in for my final proposal by involving stakeholders directly in the design process. I needed to get everyone in the room for a design workshop.

#### Goals
As I prepared for this workshop, I had four goals:

1. Align all stakeholders on the needs and requirements of this software product.
2. Bring together subject-matter-experts that might not otherwise collaborate to share ideas.
3. Involve all stakeholders in the creation of an initial prototype.
4. Create stakeholder buy-in for the final solution I was to develop.

From this set of goals, I crafted the invite list and refined the day-by-day schedule. In the end, we had about a dozen participants spanning the full spectrum of stakeholders defined at the start of this project — from Eli Lilly executives to Transcriptic software engineers.

#### The Design Sprint Schedule

As the backbone for this workshop, I chose to run a Design Sprint — drawing extensively on the methodology laid out in <Link href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/">Jake Knapp's book</Link>. The general schedule for a Design Sprint looks something like this:

Over the course of five days, we would tackle each of these categories.

###### Mapping
We began our first day by generating journey maps of our various users.

These journey maps were informed by the experts in the room, as well as the extensive up-front user research I had already done. After generating these maps, we saw that the solution space broke down into the following categories:

- Setting up a chemical synthesis and submitting it to the platform
- Monitoring a synthesis while it's running on the automation
- Reviewing the results of syntheses and extracting insights to inform future work

###### Finding Inspiration
One of my favorite parts of the Design Sprint process is product pitches. In this activity, every member of the workshop quickly demonstrates any product that they think offers an interesting, compelling solution. There's no requirement that the product be obviously relevant to the focus of the Design Sprint. The purpose of this session is to prime people's creativity, offer them some inspiration and get them thinking outside of the box.

While each participant presents their chosen product, I sketched out what they drew attention to so that the group could refer back to it later.

###### Rapid Sketching
After getting people thinking about solutions, it was time to dive into ideation. We had a large group of participants, so I broke the participants up into groups to tackle these three scenarios. For each group, each group member was asked to work independently and quickly sketch out as many rough prototypes as possible.

This tightly time-boxed session forced the workshop participants to quickly generate ideas. This focus helped them drop their pre-conceived notions and constraints and focus instead on their core ideas.

###### Paper Prototyping
Following the rapid solution sketching, all participants had the time to review their solutions and produce a final iteration that incorporated their best ideas. This was an opportunity to add more detail to a solution, and fill in solutions to problems that had been neglected during the rapid sketching session.

###### Critique and Refinement
Once everyone had finished their paper prototypes, I had everyone tape their solutions to the wall anonymously for a group critique.

I gave every participant colored dots with which they could indicate interest or disagreement. Then, we all took time to silently review each solution and vote with dots on which areas we found compelling, and which we found problematic.

Following this critique session, I went over each solution out-loud, explaining the proposed solution and noting which areas received lots of positive votes, and which received more negative votes. Following each explanation, the creator of the solution was allowed to field questions from the room regarding the solution.

###### Outcome
With many paper prototypes generated and critiqued, we were out of time for the week. The material generated from this session would be my starting material for building out higher-fidelity solutions.

Overall, this week long workshop was a resounding success. The participants from across Lilly and Transcriptic were highly engaged, questioning pre-supposed beliefs and arriving at a strong shared consensus of what a Automated Chemical Synthesis interface might look like. Having directly contributed to the material that would inform my work going forward, this diverse set of stakeholders could know that their input was heard, and their ideas documented.

Thanks for making it this far! You might want to head back over to the Automated Chemical Synthesis case study to see how I leveraged the work from this Design Sprint to craft a new software experience for Medicinal Chemists.
