excerpt: "One of the most common tasks for a Transcriptic user is viewing datasets generated from the experiments
we run for them. The data viewing and interpretation tools available to life scientists today are surprisingly limited,
and a powerful feature of Transcriptic is the ability to immediately explore and understand data right in the
Transcriptic webapp. However, this experience had suffered neglect and needed UX and engineering improvements."

#### Problem Statement
Transcriptic offers full transparency into the data captured during an experiment. When we execute a user's experiment, we present the data collected as soon as it's available, in a visually rich format. This immediacy and ability to visually review results is a huge value-add for our users.

However, before this project, the UI architecture for viewing and analyzing datasets on Transcriptic was crumbling. Our users love having specific data visualizations for different types of experiments, but maintaining these many views was time-consuming and prone to bugs. Dataset views often broke, and adding new views required extensive custom coding.

<Image hasShadow name="as-is" caption="The as-is experience for viewing datasets prior to this project was prone to bugs and visually messy." />

Furthermore, our approach to generating datasets had fundamental flaws. When a user requested to download a dataset, it was generated on the fly using the current state of the system. This caused inconsistencies between downloads and prevented proper auditing – a huge liability.

Finally, the existing interface lacked clean aesthetics and made it difficult for users to quickly interpret their results.

##### Stakeholders
Working from the initial framing of this project, I identified the following stakeholder groups for which my solution would need to work:

<MdxLayout layout="1:1:1" fullWidth showBorderBottom>
  <ItemBlurb
    image={<Image name="scientist-human" disablePreview imgStyle={{ objectFit: 'contain' }} />}
    imageSize={{ width: 180, height: 180 }}
  >

  ###### Scientist Users
  The external users of Transcriptic hold many different titles, from Lab Managers to Accountants to Scientists. However, Scientists are typically the only members of a team that analyze datasets, so their needs will be the focus of this project.

  <ItemBlurb
    image={<Image name="employee-human" disablePreview imgStyle={{ objectFit: 'contain' }} />}
    imageSize={{ width: 180, height: 180 }}
  >

  ###### Internal Scientists
  A good portion of Transcriptic's daily users are Transcriptic employees, responsible for customer success, scientific development, or simple lab maintenance. These individuals are frequent consumers of datasets.

    imageSize={{ width: 180, height: 180 }}
  >

  ###### Software Engineers
  As Transcriptic adds new scientific capabilities, our engineering team is responsible for building out the accompanying dataset visualizations. My proposals need to reduce the engineering team's burden and likelihood of introducing visual bugs.

  </ItemBlurb>
</MdxLayout>

##### Job To Be Done
Transcriptic's Head of Product and I developed a single *Job To Be Done* to guide this project. A solution that addresses this Job To Be Done will address the individual needs of each stakeholder group.

> As a biologist using Transcriptic, I want to view and access the data generated in an experiment in a single location, so that I can quickly understand if an experiment was successful, and know how I should proceed with my work.

#### Research and Exploration
##### User Research
<Image name="affinity-mapping" caption="Synthesis artifacts following user research." />

With our job-to-be-done in place, I began a round of extensive 1:1 interviews with members of each stakeholder group. From these conversations I identified the following *pain points*:

1. Scientists struggle to quickly understand the basic outcome of their experiments, due to a cluttered interface, the need to download data files before viewing them, and changes in display between datasets from different experiments.
2. Scientists have no way to understand the state of the world when their data was generated, such as how much liquid was in a container when it was measured. This makes it extremely difficult to understand why an experiment might have failed.
3. When Scientists need to compare values from multiple datasets, their workflow is slow due to a poor navigation experience.
4. Scientists struggle to access the specific data they need from an experiment, and often end up downloading far more data than necessary.
5. Internal Scientists struggle to release new features to customers in a timely manner due to the long time required for software engineering to implement new dataset views.
6. Software Engineers must spend many hours duplicating and modifying UI code from other dataset views in order to implement new ones.

##### User Needs
From these pain points, I narrowed the scope of the project down to four core *user needs*:

<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="1:1:1:1" showBorderTop showBorderBottom>
<div className="center-text">

  ###### <i className="fa fa-check" /> Determine Success
  Biologists need to understand if an experiment was even modestly successful so that they can determine if a dataset is worth analyzing further.

</div>
<div className="center-text">

  ###### <i className="fa fa-search" /> Explore Data
  Biologists need to be able to sort, search and filter their data on the fly so that they can compare datasets and gain a deeper understanding of the results.

</div>
<div className="center-text">

  ###### <i className="fa fa-microscope" /> Specific Views
  Biologists need to view datasets in layouts and visualizations specific to the type of experiment that was run.

</div>
<div className="center-text">

  ###### <i className="fa fa-code" /> Quick Implementation
  Software Engineers need to quickly create new Dataset views without duplicating existing code, or introducing visual regressions.

</div>
</MdxLayout>

##### Goals
My task was to provide a re-designed user experience for navigating and accessing datasets. The core requirements were:

1. **Extensible:** The proposed solution must work in a variety of contexts, and be easily adaptable to future needs as new dataset types are added.
2. **Audit-able:** It should be clear when a dataset was generated and apparent that the data contained within a dataset is static and represents a past state of the system.
3. **Compose-able:** Datasets are made up of Data Objects, and this solution should visually mirror that architecture.
4. **Useable:** Biologists have well defined approaches to data. Our solution should not dictate a preferred approach but instead meet Biologists where they stand.

##### Initial Sketches
<Gallery caption="Rough sketches of the known dataset types.">
  <Image name="sketch1" />
  <Image name="sketch2" />
</Gallery>

My initial sketches focused on the core components needed to appropriately display data objects, with some basic attention paid to layout. These sketches were foundational to the final architecture proposed.

##### Architecture Brainstorming
<MdxLayout layout="1:1">
  <div>

  My sketches produced the beginnings of a visual system, which I decided to develop into a full framework from which a multitude of layouts could be composed.

  To develop this framework, I detailed all of the data types we supported. Then, I audited the Transcriptic database to find the following most commonly executed experiments:

- AutoPick
- Plate Reader
- Flow Cytometry
- qPCR
- Aliquot Measurement


  </div>
  <Image hasShadow name="hierarchy-brainstorming" caption="Original brainstorming sketches for development of dataset visual system." />
</MdxLayout>

In the interest of solving for the <TextTip content={<span><b>User Need #3:</b> Biologists need to view datasets in layouts and visualizations specific to the type of experiment that was run.</span>}>third user need</TextTip>, I drew on my learnings from our scientist users and developed layouts optimized specifically for these common experiment types.

#### Final Proposal
Based on this exploration, I proposed a four level hierarchy:

> Primitives <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" /> Layouts  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  Templates  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  Summaries

##### Primitives
Primitives are the basic visualizations we support. They are the atomic units from which all dataset views can be created. I designed and coded five of them, along with a set of Data Visualizations.

<MdxLayout layout="1:1" showBorderTop fullWidth>
  <div>

  ###### Image
  Images of containers allow scientists to understand the physical state of their container.

  <StorybookLink href="https://amino-storybook.transcriptic.com/?path=/story/controlledzoompan--controlledzoompan" />
  <Image name="image-primitive" />
  </div>
  <div>

  ###### Code Block
  JSON snippets can be displayed in a formatted view when no superior visualization is available.

  <StorybookLink href="https://amino-storybook.transcriptic.com/?path=/story/fileviewer--json-file" />
  <Image name="code-block-primitive" />
  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="1:1" fullWidth>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### CSV
  CSV Data Objects can be displayed along with searching and sorting capabilities.

  <StorybookLink href="https://amino-storybook.transcriptic.com/?path=/story/csvviewer--lots-of-data-with-header" />
  <Image name="csv-primitive" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Plate Map
  Data Objects that represent single values for wells in a plate can be visualized as a plate map.

  <StorybookLink href="https://amino-storybook.transcriptic.com/?path=/story/plate--default" />
  <Image name="plate-map-primitive" />
  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="1:1" fullWidth>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Table
  Structured data not stored as a CSV is rendered in a table layout.

  <StorybookLink href="https://amino-storybook.transcriptic.com/?path=/story/datatable--small" />
  <Image name="table-primitive" />
  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="1" fullWidth showBorderBottom>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Data Visualization
  Often, basic plots and graphs help scientists digest an experiment's results. This set of data visualization primitives addresses the vast majority of our user's needs.

</MdxLayout>

##### Layouts
*Primitives* <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" /> **Layouts**  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  *Templates*  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  *Summaries*

The next level of the hierarchy is *Layouts*. While a large number of possible arrangements exist within our 12 column grid, I selected a small subset for use in datasets. This allows us to write template components and reduce the engineering overhead of implementing new dataset views.

<MdxLayout layout="1:1:1" fullWidth showBorderBottom showBorderTop>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### 12 Column Layout

  <Image hasShadow name="12-column-layout" caption="Visualizations that use only a single primitive make use of a basic, full width layout." />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### 10:2 Column Layout

  <Image hasShadow name="10-2-column-layout" caption="Graphics that benefit from larger scale can display a small amount of supplemental data alongside in a 10:2 layout." />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### 9:3 Column Layout

  <Image hasShadow name="9-3-column-layout" caption="Smaller graphics with more substantial supplemental data leverage a 9:3 layout." />
  </div>
</MdxLayout>

##### Templates
*Primitives* <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" /> *Layouts*  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  **Templates**  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  *Summaries*

*Layouts* are used by *Templates* for clean, consistent content display. I defined four types of templates, each of which leverages one of the predefined layouts shown above. Every Template presents structured data, often previewed with a graphic such as a Plate Map or Data Visualization.

Drawing on my initial visual exploration, I mocked out high-fidelity examples of each template type. Along with each mock, I proposed a JSX structure for rendering it, to ensure that my proposals could be reflected by simple, sparse UI code.

<MdxLayout showBorderTop fullWidth layout="7:5">
<div>

  ###### Single Data Object
  Used when no graphic representation of the data object is readily available. This Template is intended to be used sparingly, as <TextTip content={<span><b>User Need #3:</b> Biologists need to view datasets in layouts and visualizations specific to the type of experiment that was run.</span>}>the user needs</TextTip> are best addressed with visual representations of data.

</div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
  <Image hasShadow name="single-graphic-template" />

```jsx
<Layout datasetInfo={dataset.info}>
  <Column12>
    <CSVViewer data={dataset.csv} />
  </Column12>
</Layout>
```

</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Main Graphic with Supporting Data
  Used when the primary user need is to see visual patterns in the data. The supporting data helps provide context for the visualization, helping to solve for the <TextTip content={<span><b>User Need #2:</b> Biologists need to be able to sort, search and filter their data on the fly so that they can compare datasets and gain a deeper understanding of the results.</span>}>second user need</TextTip>.

</div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
  <Image hasShadow name="single-graphic-supporting-data-template" />

```jsx
<Layout datasetInfo={dataset.info}>
  <Column9>
    <PlateMap data={dataset.plateData} />
  </Column9>
  <Column3>
    <Table data={dataset.plateData} />
  </Column3>
</Layout>
```

</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Structured Data with Supporting Graphic
  Used when the primary user need is to see and explore structured data. The user is looking not for a visual pattern, but rather to scan a set of structured data.

</div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
  <Image hasShadow name="structured-data-supporting-graphic-template" />

```jsx
<Layout datasetInfo={dataset.info}>
  <Column12>
    <CSVViewer data={dataset.csv} />
  </Column12>
  <Column12>
    <BarChart data={dataset.chartData} />
  </Column12>
</Layout>
```

</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth layout="7:5">
<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Main Graphic with Supporting Graphic and Data
  Used when the primary user need is to see visualized data for recognizing patterns. The supporting graphic and data provide more structured views of the same data.

</div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout fullWidth showBorderBottom layout="7:5">
  <Image hasShadow name="main-graphic-supporting-graphic-structured-data-template" />

```jsx
<Layout datasetInfo={dataset.info}>
  <Column12>
    <LineChart data={dataset.chartData} />
  </Column12>
  <Column9>
    <PlateMap data={dataset.plateData} />
  </Column9>
  <Column3>
    <Table data={dataset.plateData} />
  </Column3>
</Layout>
```

</MdxLayout>

##### Summaries
*Primitives* <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" /> *Layouts*  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  *Templates*  <i className="fal fa-long-arrow-right" />  **Summaries**

Finally, datasets of specific types are represented as a *Summary View* that leverages one or more of the *Templates*. A Summary View brings the entire framework together and presents specific layouts for different experiment types, answering for the <TextTip content={<span><b>User Need #3:</b> Biologists need to view datasets in layouts and visualizations specific to the type of experiment that was run.</span>}>third user need</TextTip>. The key features of a Summary View are:

- Understand the type of instruction the dataset was created from, along with the time it was created, and the robotic infrastructure on which it was created, offering invaluable context to the user.
- Quickly download either all of the raw data for a dataset, or single data objects, for use in other analysis tools.
- See the details for the physical container from which data was collected. This is critical information that helps scientists contextualize the results.

<MdxLayout layout="2:1" showBorderTop fullWidth>
  <div>
    <Image hasShadow name="plate-reader-summary" />
  </div>
  <div>

  ###### AutoPick, Plate Reader and Flow Cytometry
  These are some of the most common experiment types Transcriptic users run. All three can be represented using a *Graphic with Supporting Data* template. The data from these experiments are best represented with visual primitives such as a Plate Map or Image, and then supported with data points from which those primitives are rendered.

  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="2:1" fullWidth>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>
    <Image hasShadow name="qpcr-summary" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### qPCR
  The qPCR dataset is a workhorse of the Transcriptic platform and users need to explore this data in a multitude of ways. A *Graphic with Supporting Graphic and Data* template allows the display of time series data, as well as specific data from each time series. A Line Chart is used as the base of the qPCR plot, and is the main graphic for quickly visualizing and understanding the success of the experiment. A Plate Map and its associated data is used alongside the line plot to provide additional context.

  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="2:1" fullWidth>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>
    <Image hasShadow name="multi-aliquot-measurements-summary" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Multiple Aliquot Measurements
  The Data Object details are rendered in the header. A CSV of the measured data, and a bar chart of the data are passed to the Aliquot Data with Supporting Graphic template.

  </div>
</MdxLayout>
<MdxLayout layout="2:1" fullWidth>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>
    <Image hasShadow name="file-summary" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>

  ###### Fallback Summary
  It is possible for a Dataset to be created that does not have a valid type. In this case, a simple list of Data Objects is displayed. For files such as JSON/CSV, a preview is shown.

  </div>
</MdxLayout>

#### Results
The nature of this proposal allowed for a healthy development process. While fellow engineers focused on backend modifications, I tackled the implementation of the Primitives and Layout components. This allowed our team to work independently and quickly at first. Then, with the various components in place, we collaborated to tie all the pieces together.

<Image name="ipad-dataset-view" caption="Screenshot of a customer's qPCR dataset taken from the Strateos webapp." />

Overall, the project was incredibly well received by internal and external users. We heard from our own employees and our customers that they found their datasets far more approachable, and that they were able to evaluate the outcome of an experiment at a glance – success!
