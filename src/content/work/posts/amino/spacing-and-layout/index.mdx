excerpt: "Design Systems are often seen as a luxury in which only large teams with lots of time and resources can invest. The reality is that, much like any other investment, they pay larger dividends the sooner they're implemented. Amino is Transcriptic's Design System which I've led the development of since early 2018. This is the story of how Amino, the first Design System for the life sciences, was brought to life."
