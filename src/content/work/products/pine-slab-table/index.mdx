##### Process
Building this table was a fun experience using materials and resources local to where I grew up in Midcoast Maine. I acquired the pine slabs for the table at a local sawmill. The pine tree they were from had been felled on the property, and I helped the mill's owner to process and plane the boards before bringing them home.
