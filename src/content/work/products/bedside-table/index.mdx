previewImage: "featured-table.jpg"
excerpt: "I built this night-stand out of some left-over Cherry and Mahogany I had in the woodshop. It's been gracing the side of my bed for several years now and is perfect for a bedside candle and whatever book I'm trying to make it thorough."
features:
  - "Mahogany drawer slides on waxed skids."
  - "Legs were milled using a table saw, a hand-held router, and some jigs."
