featuredAlt: "A SolidWorks rendering of a French Press."
excerpt: "I modeled this French Press in SolidWorks, using my favorite coffee apparatus product as reference. I made the model for a Computer Aided Design course and made the renders just for fun. The course focused on modeling from a mechanical engineering perspective; namely preparing the assets required for mass production."
