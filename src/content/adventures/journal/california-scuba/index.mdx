excerpt: "In the winter of 2016, my friends and I decided to get our Scuba certifications. By the summer, we were itching to try it out, so we put together a little excursion to San Diego. We got in two full days of diving in La Jolla and off of Catalina Island. Here's a little peak at the adventure."
